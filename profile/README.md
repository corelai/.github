a hybrid between science-fiction lore, real-world infrastructure, and bleeding-edge technology.

## 🧬 Mission

Corelai exists to explore and prototype **complex, modular software systems**  
through a sci-fi-inspired narrative of an interplanetary 4X journey.  
It’s not just code — it’s *infrastructure with identity*.
